Wesabot
=======

Wesabot, the Campfire bot framework.

Description
-----------
Wesabot is a Campfire bot framework we've been using and developing at Wesabe since not long after our inception. It started as a way to avoid parking tickets near our office ("Wes, remind me in 2 hours to move my car"), and has evolved into an essential work aid. When you enter the room, Wes greets you with a link to the point in the transcript where you last left. You can also ask him to bookmark points in the transcript, send an sms message (well, an email) to someone, or even post a tweet, among other things. His functionality is easily extendable via plugins.

To give Wes new powers, simply drop a plugin file in the plugins directory and restart Wes (or, via the ReloadPlugin, he can be told to reload himself). See `campfire/polling_bot/sample_plugin.rb` for more information, or just browse the included plugins. Some of the plugins are somewhat Wesabe-specific (like DeployPlugin, which lets us see what commits are on deck to be deployed), but can be adapted or ignored as you see fit.

If any of your plugins need to use a database, just drop a Datamapper model in the plugins/models directory and it will be automatically loaded.

Installation
------------

You'll need SQLite3 installed (http://www.sqlite.org/), and a number of gems:

    sudo gem install json dm-core dm-migrations do_sqlite3 activesupport httparty mime-types chronic dm-sqlite-adapter twitter-stream

Then copy `wesabot-sample.rb` to `wesabot.rb` and add your Campfire credentials.

Once Wes (or whatever you decide to name your bot) is running, you can see a list of available commands by entering into Campfire:

    Wes, help
